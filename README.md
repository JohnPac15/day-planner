## Day Planner is a nine to five workday task to-do list. If your trying to plan your calls with clients or your day is so busy it seems like you never take your foot off the gas pedal, Day Planner can help virtually anyone from forgetting to do something. Day Planner has been built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, but I added a few third-party servers to help with some of the legwork. The page was styled using BootStrap, the time I am generating is achieved by using Moment, and within my javascript file, I have some Jquery methods being used. When you open the Day Planner you will be welcomed to the site by our welcome title, and the current date and time. Having the current date and time displayed is to remind the user of which month we are in, what day out of the month we are on, and which hour it currently is. Time is money, and if you are in the need of a Day Planner. Then you most certainly care about the date and time. You will notice that as your day moves forward, the time blocks will change colors. If your time block turns the color blue, that means your todo-item is in the future and is waiting for you to complete that task. If the time block is yellow, that means you have one hour to complete this item before you miss your deadline. Finally, if the time block turns red, that means you missed your deadline and need to complete that task ASAP. All of the color-changing functionality is preform by careful use of "if statements" and using the HTML elements "id"'s to compare with the current time on your webpage. If you want to add a new task, simply press the plus button on the time block you are wishing to add this task to, and you will see a new text-field pop-up. From there, fill out that text field, and press the save button with the file on it. The page will automatically reload after pressing the save button, and the new task will display in the time block you selected. All the secrets behind this functionality are laced with event listeners, query selectors, and innerHTML. Day Planner's development had major ups and downs for me, but after hours working, and reworking the code, I finally have an app I am proud to call mine. I learned a lot during the journey of building Day Planner, and this app has made me a better Developer.
